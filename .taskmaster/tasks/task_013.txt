# Task ID: 13
# Title: Add Page Transitions and Polish Animations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement smooth page transitions using PageTransition component and polish all animations
# Details:
**1. Update app/layout.tsx:**
- Wrap {children} with PageTransition component
- Ensure proper AnimatePresence setup
- Pass pathname as key for transitions

**2. Polish existing animations:**
- Review all FadeUpAnimation usages
- Add stagger delays where appropriate (especially for lists/grids)
- Ensure consistent transition durations (0.3s-0.5s)

**3. Add micro-interactions:**
- Button hover states (scale-105 or opacity changes)
- Card hover lift animations
- Icon hover rotations (Github, ExternalLink icons)
- Smooth color transitions on all interactive elements

**4. Optimize animation performance:**
- Use transform and opacity for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Avoid animating width/height directly
- Add will-change: transform on animated elements if needed

**5. Mobile-specific animations:**
- Reduce motion on mobile (prefers-reduced-motion media query)
- Simplify or disable complex animations on small screens
- Test touch interactions

**6. Scroll animations (optional bonus):**
- Use Intersection Observer or Framer Motion's useInView
- Fade in sections as they enter viewport
- Parallax effect on hero photo (subtle)

# Test Strategy:
Page transitions smooth between all routes, no layout shifts, animations don't impact performance (60fps), mobile animations work well, no animation flicker
