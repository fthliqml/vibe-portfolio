# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Projects List Page with Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build Projects page with grid layout, category filtering, and project cards
# Details:
Create app/projects/page.tsx:

**Metadata:**
```typescript
export const metadata = {
  title: "Projects | M. Fatihul Iqmal",
  description: "Explore my portfolio of full-stack development projects",
};
```

**Header:**
- Title: "Projects"
- Optional description/subtitle

**Filter Section:**
- Filter buttons: All, Front-End, Back-End, Fullstack
- State: useState for active filter
- Buttons styled: rounded-full border hover effects
- Active button: bg-primary text-white

**Projects Grid:**
- Get filtered projects based on active filter
- Grid: grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6
- Use ProjectCard component
- Empty state: "No projects found" if filtered results empty

**Interactions:**
- Filter buttons update active state
- Projects re-render based on filter
- Smooth transitions between filter changes (AnimatePresence)

**Animations:**
- FadeUpAnimation wrapper
- Stagger effect for project cards (layout animation)

**Client Component:**
- Mark as "use client" for filter state management

# Test Strategy:
All projects display initially, filters work correctly, category filtering accurate, empty state shows when needed, animations smooth, responsive grid
